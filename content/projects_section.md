## Biostatistics Project: Lung Cancer Survival Time Analysis

The lung cancer survival time analysis project represents one of my most significant contributions to biostatistical research. In this comprehensive study, I examined the complex factors influencing survival outcomes among lung cancer patients, with a particular focus on developing corrected survival time estimates that account for various confounding variables. The project emerged from the recognition that traditional survival analyses often fail to adequately address the multifaceted nature of cancer progression and treatment response, potentially leading to biased estimates and suboptimal clinical decision-making.

Working with a rich dataset encompassing patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment protocols, and longitudinal outcomes, I implemented advanced statistical methodologies to derive more accurate survival predictions. The analytical approach incorporated Cox proportional hazards modeling with time-dependent covariates, competing risk analysis, and multiple imputation techniques to address missing data challenges. This multifaceted statistical framework allowed for a nuanced examination of how factors such as age, cancer stage, comorbidities, and treatment modalities interact to influence survival trajectories.

One of the most innovative aspects of this project was the development of a correction methodology that adjusts survival estimates based on patient-specific risk profiles. By integrating clinical variables with genomic markers, I created a more personalized approach to survival prediction that outperformed conventional models in both discrimination and calibration metrics. The corrected survival time estimates demonstrated significantly improved accuracy when validated against independent patient cohorts, with particularly notable enhancements in predictions for patients with complex comorbidities or non-standard treatment regimens.

The findings from this project have substantial clinical implications, potentially informing treatment planning, resource allocation, and patient counseling in oncology settings. By providing more precise survival estimates, clinicians can better tailor treatment approaches to individual patient needs and communicate prognosis information with greater confidence. Additionally, the methodological framework developed through this project offers a template for similar analyses in other cancer types and chronic diseases where survival prediction remains challenging.

## Mental Health Impact Study (In Progress)

My current research endeavor explores the intricate relationship between negative language exposure and both mental and physical health outcomes. This ongoing study represents an interdisciplinary approach that bridges psychological theory with rigorous statistical methodology to examine how the words we encounter in our daily lives may influence our wellbeing on multiple levels. The project was conceived from the observation that while considerable research has examined explicit verbal abuse, less attention has been paid to the subtle yet pervasive effects of negative linguistic environments.

The study design centers around a comprehensive survey instrument I developed to capture exposure to negative language across various contexts, including workplace communications, media consumption, and interpersonal relationships. This survey incorporates validated psychological measures of mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, and stress, alongside self-reported physical health metrics and objective physiological markers where available. The methodological approach emphasizes ecological validity, capturing real-world language exposure rather than artificial laboratory conditions.

Data collection is currently underway, with a target sample of diverse participants across demographic groups to ensure generalizability of findings. The analytical plan employs structural equation modeling to examine potential mediating pathways between language exposure and health outcomes, with particular attention to psychological mechanisms such as rumination, self-concept, and perceived stress. Preliminary analyses of the initial data suggest intriguing patterns, including differential vulnerability to negative language effects based on individual resilience factors and social support networks.

As this research progresses, I anticipate developing a theoretical framework that articulates how linguistic environments contribute to the broader social determinants of health. The findings may have significant implications for workplace communication policies, media literacy education, and therapeutic interventions focused on language awareness. Additionally, the methodological tools developed through this project—particularly the negative language exposure assessment—may serve as valuable resources for future research in this emerging field.

The analytical approach combined descriptive statistics with more sophisticated techniques including pivot table analysis, conditional aggregation, and correlation analysis. I implemented custom Excel formulas to create derived variables that captured important relationships, such as income-to-commute-distance ratios and age-adjusted purchasing propensity scores. The analysis revealed several counterintuitive findings, including the discovery that middle-income customers with moderate commuting distances represented an underserved market segment with high conversion potential.

Visualization played a crucial role in communicating these insights, with carefully designed charts that highlighted key relationships while maintaining visual clarity. I created an interactive dashboard using Excel's data validation and conditional formatting features, allowing stakeholders to explore different customer segments and immediately visualize how various factors influenced purchasing behavior. This interactive approach facilitated a more intuitive understanding of complex multivariate relationships that might otherwise have remained obscured in tabular data.

The business impact of this analysis was substantial, informing a targeted marketing campaign that increased conversion rates by focusing resources on the identified high-potential segments. Additionally, the project demonstrated how sophisticated analytics can be performed using widely available tools like Excel when applied with analytical creativity and domain understanding. The methodologies developed during this project have since been adapted for similar analyses across other product categories, creating a sustainable analytical framework for ongoing business intelligence.
