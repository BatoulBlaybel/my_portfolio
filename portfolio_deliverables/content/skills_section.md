## Data Analysis & Statistics

My foundation in data analysis and statistics forms the core of my professional identity. With extensive experience in statistical methodologies, I have developed a comprehensive approach to extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. My statistical expertise encompasses both descriptive and inferential techniques, allowing me to not only summarize data effectively but also to test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty with precision. I am particularly adept at survival analysis, having applied these techniques to biostatistical projects examining patient outcomes and treatment efficacy. This specialized knowledge enables me to handle time-to-event data with the nuance it requires, accounting for censoring and competing risks that often complicate healthcare analytics.

Beyond traditional statistical approaches, I excel at exploratory data analysis, where I combine statistical rigor with creative visualization to uncover patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden. My analytical process always begins with thorough data cleaning and validation, ensuring that subsequent analyses rest on a foundation of high-quality information. I am experienced in handling missing data through various imputation techniques, addressing outliers appropriately, and transforming variables to meet the assumptions of statistical models. This meticulous attention to data preparation reflects my commitment to producing reliable, reproducible results that stakeholders can confidently use for decision-making.

## Data Visualization

Transforming complex data into clear, compelling visualizations is one of my greatest strengths. I believe that effective data visualization is both an art and a scienceâ€”requiring technical skill, design sensibility, and a deep understanding of human perception. Using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python's visualization libraries, I create interactive dashboards and static visualizations that communicate insights at a glance while inviting deeper exploration. My approach to visualization is always purpose-driven, selecting chart types and design elements that best serve the specific analytical goals and audience needs.

I have particular expertise in creating visualizations for time-series data, geospatial analysis, and multivariate relationships. My work with the COVID-19 project demonstrated my ability to present epidemiological data in ways that highlighted temporal trends while accounting for geographical variations. Similarly, my Airbnb analysis visualizations effectively communicated complex pricing patterns across different neighborhoods and property types. I pay careful attention to accessibility in my visualizations, ensuring color choices that work for colorblind viewers and maintaining clarity across different display sizes. This thoughtful approach to visualization design reflects my belief that data insights should be accessible to all stakeholders, regardless of their technical background.

## Programming & Tool Proficiency

My technical toolkit spans multiple programming languages and specialized software, allowing me to select the right tool for each analytical challenge. In Python, I am proficient in data manipulation with pandas, statistical modeling with statsmodels and scikit-learn, and visualization with matplotlib and seaborn. My Python skills extend to machine learning implementation, where I have developed classification, regression, and clustering models for various applications, including my movie industry analysis project. I approach programming with an emphasis on readability and maintainability, creating well-documented code that can be understood and built upon by others.

SQL forms another cornerstone of my technical expertise, enabling me to efficiently query and manipulate large databases. I am comfortable writing complex joins, subqueries, and window functions to extract precisely the data needed for analysis. My COVID-19 data analysis project showcased my ability to use SQL for data preparation before visualization in Tableau, demonstrating how I leverage different tools in complementary ways. Additionally, I am proficient in Excel for data analysis, using advanced functions, pivot tables, and Power Query for data transformation tasks. My bike buyers performance analysis exemplifies how I can derive sophisticated insights even from seemingly straightforward tools when applied with analytical creativity.

## Business Intelligence

My experience with business intelligence tools like Power BI and Tableau has equipped me to bridge the gap between technical analysis and business decision-making. I excel at designing intuitive dashboards that allow stakeholders to interact with data and discover insights relevant to their specific questions. The job satisfaction analysis I conducted using Power BI demonstrates my ability to present HR metrics in ways that highlight trends and correlations while enabling drill-down into specific departments or time periods. I approach dashboard design with a focus on user experience, ensuring that navigation is intuitive and that the most important insights are immediately apparent.

Beyond the technical aspects of BI implementation, I understand the organizational context in which these tools operate. I have experience collaborating with business stakeholders to identify key performance indicators, design appropriate visualizations, and establish data refresh processes that ensure dashboards remain current and valuable. This holistic approach to business intelligence reflects my belief that technical solutions must be aligned with organizational needs and integrated into decision-making processes to deliver real value.

## Research & Methodology

My research skills combine scientific rigor with practical application, allowing me to design studies that produce valid, actionable insights. I am experienced in survey design and implementation, as demonstrated by my ongoing mental health study examining the impact of negative language on physical wellbeing. This project showcases my ability to develop research questions, design appropriate measurement instruments, and plan analyses that will address the core hypotheses while accounting for potential confounding factors. I approach research design with careful attention to validity threats, implementing controls and randomization where appropriate to strengthen causal inferences.

My methodological expertise extends to experimental design, observational studies, and mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative and qualitative data. I am particularly interested in longitudinal research designs that capture changes over time, allowing for more nuanced understanding of dynamic processes. In all my research work, I maintain a commitment to ethical standards, ensuring informed consent, data privacy, and responsible reporting of findings. This ethical foundation, combined with methodological rigor, enables me to produce research that is not only scientifically sound but also respectful of the individuals whose data contributes to our understanding.
