# Portfolio Structure Draft

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive structure for a unique data science portfolio website that showcases statistical analysis, data visualization, and programming skills. The portfolio will feature a distinctive purple and black color scheme and highlight various completed and in-progress projects while maintaining a professional yet personal tone.

## Site Architecture

The portfolio will be structured as a single-page application with smooth scrolling between sections, providing an intuitive and seamless user experience. The navigation will be clear and accessible, allowing visitors to quickly find relevant information about skills, projects, and contact details.

## Header and Navigation

The header will feature a minimalist design with a subtle purple gradient background transitioning to black. The navigation menu will be positioned at the top right, with clean typography in white for maximum contrast and readability. On mobile devices, this will collapse into a hamburger menu that expands when clicked.

The navigation will include links to the following sections:
- Home
- About
- Skills
- Projects
- Contact

A personal logo or stylized name will appear in the top left corner, serving as both branding and a home button. This element will incorporate the purple and black color scheme in a creative way that reflects data visualization aesthetics.

## Hero Section

The hero section will make a strong first impression with a full-width design featuring:

- A professional headline identifying the portfolio owner as a data scientist and statistical analyst
- A brief, compelling tagline that emphasizes expertise in biostatistics and data visualization
- A stylized background that subtly incorporates data visualization elements like graphs or charts in purple and black
- A prominent call-to-action button directing visitors to the projects section

This section will establish both professional credibility and visual identity immediately upon landing on the page.

## About Section

The about section will provide a more detailed introduction, balancing professional background with personal elements. It will include:

- A professional headshot or representative image (or space for one to be added later)
- A narrative about the journey into data science and statistics
- Educational background and relevant qualifications
- Professional interests and specializations, particularly highlighting biostatistics expertise
- A personal touch that humanizes the portfolio without oversharing

The text will be presented in a clean, readable format with adequate spacing and possibly subtle animations that reveal content as the user scrolls.

## Skills Section

The skills section will visually represent technical proficiencies using a combination of:

- Skill categories (Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, Programming, etc.)
- Tool proficiency indicators for specific technologies (Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Python)

Each skill category will include:
1. A distinctive icon or visual element
2. A brief description of capabilities in that area
3. Specific tools or methodologies mastered
4. Relevant certifications or notable achievements

This section will be designed as a grid that reorganizes responsively on different screen sizes, maintaining visual appeal and readability.

   - Two additional data science projects with brief descriptions

Each project will have a consistent layout but with unique visual elements that reflect the project's content and tools used.

## Contact Section

The contact section will provide a clean, user-friendly way for potential employers or collaborators to reach out. It will include:

- A contact form with fields for:
